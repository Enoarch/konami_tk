## What is the "Konami code" ?

[The Konami by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code "Wikipedia")

## What is the purpose of the code ?

This short script allow to launch an event if the Konami code is made (with the keyboard)  on the Tkinter HMI.

### for the story ...

I made it to sign all my tkinter projects... I really love [easterEggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media) "Wikipedia")  :)

## How to launch the script ?

With a terminal (*note that python min 3.0 is required*), type : `python guy.py`

Now, in the IHM of the app, made the Konami code with the keyboard and you will see the result...
